This is a CouchApp I have written for fun and to demonstrate how to test drive CouchApps with Cucumber. Its purpose is to help learn new (spoken) languages by providing tools to learn grammar or vocabulary.

Warning: This app is not ready to deployed onto the internet, specifically because user passwords are only "encrypted" by reversing them and user authentication happens by setting the username in a cookie, which can be forged by anyone who can write one line of JavaScript.
