## About

This is a CouchApp I have written for fun and to demonstrate how to test drive CouchApps with Cucumber. Its purpose is to help learn new (spoken) languages by providing tools to learn grammar or vocabulary.

Warning: This app is not ready to deployed onto the internet, specifically because user passwords are only "encrypted" by reversing them and user authentication happens by setting the username in a cookie, which can be forged by anyone who can write one line of JavaScript.

## Next steps

### General

* proper user authentication
* prevent people from
** accessing/changing design doc
** accessing user documents
* edit tasks (clozes/translations)
** keep history in case something goes wrong

### Translations

* reveal translations when done, esp. the incorrect ones
* randomize order of translations
* do translations in reverse 
* find more general term

### New Features
* record history and show graph of improvement
